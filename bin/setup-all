#   {{go}} {{cmd}} [<site_name> <key_file> <email_address> <alt_name>...]
#
# This will run all of the following:
#
#   {{go}} certbot-setup
#   {{go}} site-setup
#   {{go}} get-cert
#
# The arguments are the same as those for `{{go}} site-setup`, and they are all
# optional, as the user will be prompted to enter the necessary information as
# needed. See `{{go}} help site-setup` for more information.
#
# If successful, you can then run {{go}} webserver-config to generate a
# configuration file for your web server that makes use of the new certificate
# and associated artifacts.
